        <p class="sample-text">
            In Today’s world, with the hassle of various activities in the household; Home Automation systems are used to make everyone lives simpler, more convenient, safer, by having the ability to control appliances at the tip of our fingers.
        </p>
        <p class="sample-text">
            Even though there may be countless systems that are conventionally available around the globe, which are more advanced and covers a wider range of features like Front Door lock, Smart Locks, Home protection, climate control, Alarm Systems, there is always going to be even minor drawbacks in them, which we are hoping to fulfill with our Smart Home System.
        </p>
        <p class="sample-text">
            The ones currently available are relatively expensive, and therefore our proposed system, would fit into the budget of many families, who want to have more independence and control over their home, and have their mind at ease when they travel for holidays, or even leave the house in a haste and suddenly experience the feeling of dread on whether they left any appliance on or left the door, window or garage open.
        </p>
        <p class="sample-text">
            During Stormy weathers, service work or the random power cuts that suddenly occur, the power gets cut immediately and as soon as it goes, there are times that it comes back as well and along with it comes a very high voltage. When the power surges back on after an outage, it typically exceeds the maximum limit, and this could create high levels of heat and potentially damage the appliance. Our proposed system would ensure to protect these appliances by acting as a surge protector; which would keep the power at a safe level instead of letting all of it flow into the appliance & electronics. Hence, giving a peace of mind when there’s a storm or power outage.
        </p>
        <p class="sample-text">
            And henceforth, taking the above facts into account and many more, our aim is to develop a smart, reliable, and most importantly affordable, smart home system which would make the life of many families easy and save ample time and effort, and also increase the home efficiency.
