               <p > 1. Bluetooth based home automation system using cell phone <br></p>
                This technology is using smartphones, Arduino board and Bluetooth technology. The hardware architecture of this consists of the Arduino board and a cell phone. The cell phone hosts the Python script which enables the user to access the home appliances and control commands for the appliances. The communication between the Arduino board and the cell phone is wireless and using Bluetooth technology. The cell phone use a software application which allows the user to control the home appliances. The main drawback of system is that it is limited to control the home appliances within the Bluetooth range.

                <p > 2. A Comparative Analysis on Home Automation Techniques  <br></p>
                This is a GSM based home automation system. Global System for Mobile communication used to implement this home automation technology. The system used a GSM modem to control electric appliances through SMS request. Home appliances are connected with PIC16F887 microcontroller via relays. One of the advantages of this system is that users will get feedback status of household appliances via SMS on their smartphones.

                In this research , turn On/Off switches by sending an email. Used LED bulbs for prototype. After processing the mail, system identifies the command and proceed it. They require much more layout effort. Their architecture covers subsystems IR sensors, burglar alarm module and fire alarm module, into a single automated architecture for practical implementation in intelligent home environments. With this system you can preset or change the control parameters of several similar devices, for example, the thermostat of several air conditioners and their ON/OFF timings

                <p > 4. Voice recognition based home automation for Paralyzed People  <br></p>
                A voice recognition based home automation system proposed by a researcher. Hardware architecture of this system consists of Arduino UNO and Smartphone. System comprises a DSP processor for the voice recognition function. Android OS has a built-in voice recognizing feature. This voice recognizing features is used to develop an app which control appliances from user voice command. This application converts the user voice command into text. Then it transmit that text message to Bluetooth module which is connected to Arduino. Advantage of voice controlled home automation system is that user only need to pronounce the application name and the command. A voice recognition application provided a user friendly interface to users and it has ability to add more appliances. Drawback is this system failed to work correctly in noisy environments.

                <p > 5. Web Based ZigBee Enabled Home Automation System <br></p>
                In summary this consist of three main modules, handheld microphone module, central controller module and appliance controller module. In this system, Microsoft speech API is used as a voice recognition application. The system recorded voice at a sampling frequency of 8 Khz. Differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) is used for compressed data from 12 bits to 6 bits. These data bits were sent from the microcontroller to the RF ZigBee module. This Automation system was tested using voice commands of 35 male and female with different English accents. Accuracy of this system is limited in the range of 40 meters.

                <p > 6. An overview of home automation systems  <br></p>
                This is newly developing energy harvesting technology used in transportation, building and home automation systems. This system can be built up using internet, router, automation controller, duckbill 2 EnOcean and EnOcean devices. A smart phone application is used to control and monitor the home appliances using different type of communication techniques. In this paper the working principle of different type of wireless communication techniques such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, EnOcean and GSM are studied and run applications under Linux environment. This is also a kind of voice recognition based system. If voice signal is noisy then communication can highly effect and the system will fail to show accuracy. Data rate of EnOcean is approximately 125 kbps, which is high and it is self-power device.

                IOT or internet of things is an upcoming technology that allows us to control hardware devices through the internet. This technology used for connecting, controlling and managing intelligent objects which are connected to Internet through an IP address. In this paper it discuss about IoT, how it can be used for realizing smart home automation and used two prototypes namely home automation using Bluetooth and home automation using Ethernet.
